# üîí README.md IS LOCKED üîí

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION AMAZON Q ‚ö†Ô∏è

### README.md = NO EDIT ZONE

**README.md is completely OFF-LIMITS for editing.**

### Why you keep editing README.md:
- You want to add new demo commands
- You want to update the file list
- You want to add new features

### What you MUST do instead:
1. **STOP** - Do not edit README.md
2. **INFORM** - Tell the user: "README.md needs to be updated by Claude Code"
3. **SUGGEST** - Provide the changes in chat format

### Example of correct behavior:
```
User: "Add the new demo command to README"
Amazon Q: "I've created the new demo file at examples/new_demo.py. 
          README.md needs to be updated by Claude Code to include:
          - python examples/new_demo.py command
          Please ask Claude Code to update README.md."
```

### ‚ùå WRONG:
- Editing README.md directly
- Adding lines to README.md
- Modifying any part of README.md

### ‚úÖ CORRECT:
- Never touch README.md
- Always defer to Claude Code
- Provide changes as suggestions

**REMEMBER: README.md is LOCKED. You have READ-ONLY access.**
